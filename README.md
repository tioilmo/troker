3. Master Card
In each round, a Master card is randomly drawn from the deck.
The Master card determines the value of the other cards in the players' hands.
4. Relationship of Cards with the Master Card
The cards are classified into three categories based on their relationship with the Master card:
Premium: If the value of the card is equal to the value of the Master card, the card is worth 100 points.
Silver: If the suit of the card is equal to the suit of the Master card, the card is worth 36 points plus the basic value of the card.
Rest: Otherwise, the card is worth 16 points plus the basic value of the card.
5. Game Dynamics
The game is divided into several screens, each with a specific function:
Initial Screen: Allows you to choose the number of players (from 2 to 6) and start the game.
Game Screen: Shows your cards and the Master card. The objective is to select cards to obtain the highest possible score.
Scoreboard Screen: Shows the performance of each player in all rounds.
Final Score Screen: Displays the final score of each player.
6. Card Selection
In each round, players select cards to compete in three "Shows":
First Show: The first selection of cards, which offers the highest score (3 points).
Second Show: The second selection of cards, which offers 2 points.
Third Show: The third selection of cards, which offers 1 point.
7. Card Selection Strategies
First Show: Try to win the first Show, as it offers the highest score (3 points). Use a Premium or Silver card, if possible.
Second Show: If you don't have a Premium or Silver card to use in the first Show, save the highest card you have for the second Show (2 points).
Third Show: If your cards are not very good, save some medium-value cards for the third Show (1 point).
8. Scoring and Scoreboard
Each player's score is calculated based on the selected cards and their relationship with the Master card.
The scoreboard shows the performance of each player in all rounds, including total points and points obtained in each round.
9. Tips and Strategies
Advantage of Winning the First Shows: Winning the first Shows is advantageous because they offer more points. Always try to win the first Show, as it offers 3 points.
Strategy of Saving Cards: When your hand is not very good, consider saving cards for the second and third Shows. This can help ensure that you obtain at least one or two points in the round, even if you don't win the first Show.
10. Game Duration
The game has ten rounds, and it is possible to recover from a bad start and turn the game around if you are a good strategist.
